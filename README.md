# GitFinder

GitFinder is a way to access the public Github repositories and profile.

## Purpose
Idea is to demonstrate how to get the public profiles of github users and there basic details such as profile, location, bio etc. To accomplish this task, I have used Github API.

###### "GitFinder is an angular 8.2.0 project to get the Github Users Repositories and informations."
