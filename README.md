## Purpose
Idea is to demonstrate how to get the public profiles of github users and there basic details such as profile, location, bio etc. To accomplish this task, I have used Github API.

###### "GitFinder is an angular 8.2.0 project to get the Github Users Repositories and informations."

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ® and an npm package manager.
Install Node using below command.

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
###### Check node and npm version using below command

```bash
node -v
 
npm -v
```
### Get Repository 

Either clone this repository or fork it on GitHub and clone your fork:

```git
git clone https://github.com/shivmohan1994/GitFinder.git

cd GitFinder
```
### Install npm 

Inside your project directory run the below command to install node packages

```git
npm install
```
Now run your project using below command.

```git
ng serve --o
```
it will open the GitFinder in your default browser.

### Browser Support

I have test against Chrome and Firefox. The application will run on most modern browsers that are supported by the Angular framework. It will also support for mobile devices.
